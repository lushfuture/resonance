The idea was to create a lightweight, responsive, mobile first theme for the Ghost platform with focus on simplicity, aestethics and typography. 

The theme id built with Sass for CSS preprocessoring, Compass for all kinds of CSS goodness (Vertical Rhythm, CSS3 features&hellip;), Susy for grid math and Breakpoint for media queries. Learn more below.
