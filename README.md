# Resonance - a typography based content first responsive theme for Ghost
Resonance is an open source theme for the [Ghost](http://ghost.org/ "Ghost") blogging platform. 

View resonance in action [here](http://amlinarev.ghost.io/).

The idea was to create a lightweight, responsive, mobile first theme for the Ghost platform with focus on simplicity, aestethics and typography. 

The theme id built with Sass for CSS preprocessoring, Compass for all kinds of CSS goodness (Vertical Rhythm, CSS3 features&hellip;), Susy for grid math and Breakpoint for media queries. Learn more below. 
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com "Ghost")
- [Compass](http://compass-style.org "Ghost")
- [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net "Ghost")
- [Breakpoint](http://breakpoint-sass.com "Breakpoint")

The project is under development, feel free to report bugs and inconsistencies. It is created and tested on modern browsers. 

The project uses Ruby and Bundler for versioning to Compile the Sass files. Use it with bundle exec compass watch. More info to come.
