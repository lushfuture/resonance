# Resonance - a typography based content first responsive theme for Ghost
Resonance is an open source theme for the [Ghost](http://ghost.org/ "Ghost") blogging platform. The current supported Ghost version is 0.4.1.

View resonance in action [here](http://amlinarev.ghost.io/).

The idea was to create a lightweight, responsive, mobile first theme for the Ghost platform with focus on simplicity, aestethics and typography. 

The theme is built with Sass for CSS preprocessoring, Compass for all kinds of CSS goodness (Vertical Rhythm, CSS3 features&hellip;), Susy for grid math and Breakpoint for media queries. Learn more below. 
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com "Ghost")
- [Compass](http://compass-style.org "Ghost")
- [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net "Ghost")
- [Breakpoint](http://breakpoint-sass.com "Breakpoint")

## Key features
- Fully responsive mobile first and fluid layout using relative sizing
- Resonance is written with BEM syntax using OOP principles for maximum project control and modularity.
- Written in Sass using Compass, Susy and Breakpoint


## Compiling Sass

The project uses [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) for versioning to Compile the Sass files. The Gemfile with all of the dependancies and all of the Sass files are provided in the theme for you to customize.

### Watch for changes

    bundle exec compass watch

## Actively under development
The project is under development, and the plan is to update it as Ghost platform comes out with more features. Feel free to issue bugs and feature requests, I will try to manage them all. It is created and tested on modern browsers, your feedback is welcome.
